    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Thin crust pizza recipe with step by step pics. 
    This recipe is one of the best thin crust pizza recipe,
    which gives a <em>crisp, crunchy and light</em> thin crust pizza base.</p>
     <p>While making any pizza, be it thin crust or the thick pan pizza, 
    the pizza sauce that is used is  important as it is one of the key ingredients that flavors the entire pizza. 
    Best is to use <strong> homemade</strong> pizza sauce or you can use your favorite brand. 
    I prefer the real flavors of pizza sauce made with fresh tomatoes,
     so I make small batch of pizza sauce and refrigerate.
    It comes in handy when you want to use the tomato sauce for pizzas as well as pastas.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves Garlic</li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>Â½ cup diced smoked ham</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 550 degrees F (285 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>
            Add asparagus and cook uncovered until just tender, about 2 minutes.<br>
             Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes. <br>
             Once asparagus is cold, drain well and set aside.
            </li>
        <li>
            Combine ricotta, olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, and heavy cream in a small bowl.<br> 
            Stir in fresh herbs (if using) and set aside.
            </li>
        <li>
            To shape the pizza dough, sprinkle the countertop and dough surface with flour and lightly pat flat.<br>
             Use a rolling pin to form a thin disk about 9 inches in diameter. <br>
             Transfer to a baking sheet.
            </li>
        <li>Spread ricotta mixture over crust, top with ham and asparagus. <br>
